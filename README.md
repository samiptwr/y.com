# y.com
A site to share thoughts like facebook or twitter but kindof sick.

You can create account and post. Post can be liked and disliked. You can follow others also. You can also view other's profile and see their infos.

## How to use
To use this website, first you have to clone this in you local device. So, run the following command. For this command to work, first you must have git installed in your computer.

or

Then head to the browser and enter ``` localhost:5000 ```.

## Technologies
As always HTML, CSS, JS in frontend with ejs for rendering and nodejs with expressjs for backend. MongoDB for database. This is also not responsive.

## Insights
It was my oldest project I have done to practice backend. So it doesnot looks good. Neither UI nor functionality. You can help me by fixing the UI bugs and logic bugs.

## Licence
I know no one is interested in copying this but I have used MIT Licence. So read it.
