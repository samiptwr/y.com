# y.com
A site to share thoughts like facebook or twitter but kindof sick.

## Info
You can create account and post. Post can be liked and disliked. You can follow others also. You can also view other's profile and see their infos.

## Technologies
As always HTML, CSS, JS in frontend with ejs for rendering and nodejs with expressjs for backend. MongoDB for database. This is also not responsive.

## Insights
It was my oldest project I have done to practice backend. So it doesnot looks good. Neither UI nor functionality. You can help me by fixing the UI bugs and logic bugs.

## Licence
I know no one is interested in copying this but I have used MIT Licence. So read it.
